      <h2>Get started becoming a Paleonerd by learning 5 quick facts:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Not everything you think is a dinosaur is a dinosaur</li>
        <li>
          The velociraptors in Jurrasic Park are inaccurate.., or are they?
        </li>
        <li>Spinosaurus</li>
        <li>TRex is not the best theropod... but also, yes, it is.</li>
        <li>Chickens are not ancestors of dinosaurs... they ARE dinosaurs.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>What is and is not a dinosaur?</h3>
      <p>
        A common misconception of the public is that everything shown in
        Jurrasic Park or The Land Before Time was a dinosaur. It's an easy
        mistake to make. Big old creature from dinosaur time? === Dinosaur.
        However, that just isn't true. Take for example, pterosaurs. They are
        not in fact dinosaurs as they do not share the same common dinosaur
        ancestor. Additionally, many seas creatures were not dinosaurs either,
        including Mosasaur (the giant whale like creature fromm the sea show in
        Jurrasic World) and Megalodon (the giant shark creature). On that note,
        did you know that Sharks are older than Dinosaurs? Dinosaurs first
        appeared some 230 million years ago, while the first sharks appeared
        some 450 million years ago. Not only are sharks older than dinosaurs-
        they are older than trees (some 380 million years old)!
      </p>
      <h3>Velociraptors</h3>
      <p>
        Speaking of Jurrasic Park, for many impressionable youth, Jurrasic Park
        is their first introduction into the (cool) world of dinosaurs. This has
        led to many spinoff francises and discussions about the original film
        and it's accuracies and inaccuracies. When it was first made, Jurrasic
        Park was actually very true to what we knew about dinosaurs at the time
        (save for some creative liberties, like the venom spitting, frilled
        Dilophosaurus who we knew did not have such features). One of the
        inaccuracies that people love to point out is the wild difference
        between the Velociraptors in Jurrasic Park and what we know about
        Velociraptors today, which are closer in size to a turkey. You can see
        in the infographic below the comical difference in size and appearance.

      <p>
        While many casual people may have heard this, what Paleonerds know is
        that isn't the full story! At the time of the first movie (1993),
        paleontologists didn't have as many fossils as we do today. The fossils
        which they called velociraptor were actually a group of fossils of many
        different kinds of theropods (carnivourus dinosaurs) closely related to
        velociraptor, including deinonychus, an 11 foot long predator whose name
        literally translates to "terrible claw".

        alt="Comparison of humans to many types of raptors"
      />
      <p>
        Now that sounds more like a Jurrisc Park velociraptor, doesn't it? While
        the velociraptors in Jurrasic Park are a bit larger than deinonychus, it
        is most likely that they were based off of deinonychus rather than what
        we today call velociraptor. That said, they are all awesome dinosaurs
        who do indeed hunt in packs and are very intelligent creatures. My
        personal favorite is Utahraptor. What's yours?
      </p>
      <h3>Spinosaurus</h3>
      <p>
        Now, I may not be a huge spinosaurs fan, but if you plan on becoming a
        Paleonerd, then you HAVE to know about Spinosaurus, the running joke (of
        a truly amazing dinosaur) in the paleotology community.
      </p>
      <p>
        All dinosaurs have changed drastically since the first scientific
        records of them dating back to the last 1800s. Here are just a few of
        the dinosaurs and their first reconstructed imagings compared to what we
        have gathered today with our increaed use of better technology and
        labratory instruments and cumulative knowledge:

      />
      <p>
        It's amazing to see how many our understanding of dinosaurs has changed
        over time. A lot of advances in knowledge have even been made since the
        90s. However, while scientists are pretty darn confident we know what,
        for example, T-rex looks like now, one dinosaurs continues to evade and
        frustrate the ever living daylights out of all scientists and
        paleolovers: Spinosaurs.

        I hesitated to even provide a picture because, as the joke goes,
        spinosaurus will probably look different next week. I am not even joking
        when I say one month scientists could say "ok, we beleive that this
        dinosaur was full acquatic and walked on two feet" and the next,
        "Actually, we believe this dinosaur was only semi acquatic and it would
        have been impossible for it to only walk on twos, so it must have walked
        on fours.

        The problem is, we have very limited fossils of this fascinating
        dinosaur. It's the only theropod we know of that spent most of it's time
        in water. Combined with that fact and that it is an interesting creature
        with a huge sail and unusual snout, it's not hard to see what some
        people find it their favorite. Maybe one day, a complete fossil will be
        found, but until then, we just have to be content with the ever changing
        styles and Paleoart for this awesome dinosaur.
      </p>
      <h3>Tyrannosaurus Rex</h3>
      <img
        src="https://lede-admin.blockclubchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/07/DY3A4831.jpg?w=1080"
        alt="Sue the TRex"
      />
      <p>
        Meet Sue, one of the best and most recent full scale replicas of a Trex.
        She is currently on display at the Field Museum of Natural History in
        Chicago. What makes her special is she is one of the largest, most
        extensive, and best preserved Tyrannosaurus rex specimens ever found, at
        over 90 percent recovered by bulk. We actually know a LOT about Trex,
        from their incredible eyesight (which Jurassic Park certainly got
        wrong), that their young were likely at least partially feathered, and
        that their vocalizations probably sounded less like a tiger roar and
        more like a gigantic bellowing crocodile.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have also learned a lot about a lot of other species of dinosaur too.
        Trex was one of the first theropod fossils ever categorically discovered
        and was thusly named "King of the Lizards", but that name is incorrect
        for several reasons. For example, we now know that dinosaurs were not
        reptiles or lizards, but an entirely different type of animal. And
        second, we now know of many other theropods that are much bigger and
        stronger than Trex. For example, the afforementioned Spinosaurus is
        actually bigger than Trex in both height and length. As for stronger,
        Allosaurus, while not bigger than Trex, reportedly was much stronger and
        was able to take down pray twice the size of Trex. As a Paleonerd, it's
        important to know this as, claiming Trex to be the "strongest" or
        "biggest" carnivore will likely set of a chorus of other nerds echoing
        "that's not true!". All that said, while Trex may not be the biggest,
        one thing most of us paleonerds agree on is Trex is still the **BEST**.
        With a stronger bite force than any animal that has ever lived and a
        legend and icon of dinosauria ever since it's discovery in 1905, for
        many people around the world, Trex holds a special place in their
        hearts, and that is why Trex is the best dinosaur.
      </p>
      <h3>Chickens and Dinosaurs</h3>
      <p>
        You may have snidely heard from somewhere that chickens are the
        ancestors of the mighty trex. To be clear, this just isn't true.
        Chickens did not evolve from Trex. And birds did not evolve from
        dinosaurs... birds ARE dinosaurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same way that cats did not evolve from tigers but instead evolved
        from some common feline ancestor over 6 million years ago, birds and
        dinosaurs like Trex and Tricerotops, all evolved from the same dinosaur
        common ancestor. In other words, birds didn't evolve from some trex, but
        rather, birds ancestors lived alongside other theropods during the
        Triassic period. This graph below is a great summary of all we have
        learned so far, including how crocodilian and pterosaurs were not
        dinosaurs.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is actually one of my favorite facts about dinosaurs because it
        really drives home the point that dinosaurs ARE animals! In fact,
        paleotologists call birds "non-avian dinosaurs". It's sad sometimes to
        think about the fact we will never get to see those amazing animals in
        person- you will never meet a tricerotops or a stegosaurus or a trex
        (though, maybe that last one is for the best...). But when you truly
        observe birds, you can see it in the way that they walk and the shape of
        their feet, that they clearly are dinosaurs walking among us.
