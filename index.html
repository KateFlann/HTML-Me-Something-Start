        <h3>What is and is not a dinosaur?</h3>
        <p class="facts-paragraphs">
          A common misconception of the public is that everything shown in
          Jurrasic Park or The Land Before Time was a dinosaur. It's an easy
          mistake to make. Big old creature from dinosaur time? === Dinosaur.
          However, that just isn't true. Take for example, pterosaurs (i.e.
          pterodactyl). They are not in fact dinosaurs as they do not share the
          same common dinosaur ancestor. Additionally, many seas creatures were
          not dinosaurs either, including, Dimitrodon (the giant sail creature),
          Mosasaur (the giant whale like creature fromm the sea show in Jurrasic
          World) and Megalodon (the giant shark creature).

          FUN FACT! Did you know that Sharks are older than Dinosaurs? Not only
          are sharks older than dinosaurs- they are older than trees!

          (Dinosaurs first appeared some 230 million years ago, trees 380

        <h3>Velociraptors</h3>
        <p class="facts-paragraphs">
          Speaking of Jurrasic Park, for many impressionable youth, Jurrasic
          Park is their first introduction into the (totally rad) world of
          dinosaurs. This has led to many spin-off francises and discussions
          about the original film and it's accuracies and inaccuracies. When it
          was first made, Jurrasic Park was actually very true to what we knew
          about dinosaurs at the time (save for some creative liberties, like
          the frilled, venom-spitting Dilophosaurus who we then knew did not
          have such features). One of the inaccuracies that people love to point
          out is the wild difference between the Velociraptors in Jurrasic Park
          and what we know about Velociraptor today, which are closer in size to
          a turkey. You can see in the infographic below the comical difference
          in size and appearance.
        </p>

          alt="Comparison image of a human, a Jurassic Parkvelociraptor, and modern scientific rendeition of a velociraptor."
        />
        <p class="facts-paragraphs">
          While many casual people may have heard this, what
          <a id="paleonerd">Paleonerds</a> know is that this isn't the full
          story! At the time of the first movie (1993), paleontologists didn't
          have as many fossils of "raptors" as we do today. The fossils which
          they called "velociraptor" were actually a group of fossils at the
          time of many different kinds of raptor theropods (carnivorous
          dinosaurs), including deinonychus, an 11 foot long predator whose name
          literally translates to "terrible claw". Deinonychus and all it's
          relatives are shown below:

          alt="Comparison of humans to many types of raptors"
        />
        <p class="facts-paragraphs">
          Now that looks more like a Jurrisac Park velociraptor, doesn't it?
          While the velociraptors in Jurrasic Park are a bit larger than
          deinonychus, it is most likely that they were based off of deinonychus
          rather than what we today call "velociraptor" (Mr. Turkey). That said,
          they are all awesome predators who do indeed hunt in packs and are
          very intelligent creatures. My personal favorite raptor is Utahraptor.

        <h3>Spinosaurus</h3>
        <p class="facts-paragraphs">
          Now, I may not personally be a huge spinosaurs fan, but if you plan on
          becoming a
          <a id="paleonerd">Paleonerd</a>, then you HAVE to know about
          Spinosaurus, the running joke in the paleotology community.
        </p>
        <p class="facts-paragraphs">
          All dinosaurs have changed drastically since the first scientific
          records of them dating back to the late 1800s. Here are just a couple
          of the dinosaurs and their first reconstructed imagings compared to
          what we have reconstructed today with our increased use of better
          technology, labratory instruments, and cumulative knowledge:

        <p class="facts-paragraphs">
          It's amazing to see how many our understanding of dinosaurs has
          changed over time. A lot of advances in knowledge have been made even
          since the 90's. However, while scientists are pretty darn confident we
          know what, for example, T-rex looks like now, one dinosaurs continues
          to evade and frustrate the ever living daylights out of all scientists
          and paleolovers: Spinosaurus.

          I hesitated to even provide a picture because, as the joke goes,
          spinosaurus will probably look different next week. I am not even
          joking when I say one month scientists could say "O.K., so we beleive
          that this dinosaur was fully acquatic and walked on two feet," and the
          next say, "Actually, we believe this dinosaur was only semi-acquatic
          and it would have been impossible physically for it to only walk on
          twos, so it must have walked on fours." Here are just a few of it's
          reconstructions, most of which are from just the past couple decades!

        <p class="facts-paragraphs">
          The problem with Spinosaurus is we have very limited fossils for them
          from each site- most of them just fragments of the whole, like a
          single rib or only the back feet. What we do know, is it's the only
          theropod we have found that would have spent most of it's time in
          water (like a crocodile) consisting of a diet almost entirely of fish.
          Combined with the huge sail and unusual snout, it's not hard to see
          why some people find it their favorite. Maybe one day a complete
          fossil will be found, but until then, we just have to be content with
          the ever changing styles and Paleoart for this awesome dinosaur.

        <h3>Tyrannosaurus Rex</h3>
        <img

        />
        <p class="facts-paragraphs">
          Meet Sue, one of the best and most recent full scale replicas of a
          Trex. Ain't she a beauty? She is currently on display at the Field
          Museum of Natural History in Chicago. What makes her special is she is
          one of the largest, most extensive, and best preserved Tyrannosaurus
          rex fossils ever found, at over 90 percent recovered. We actually know
          a LOT about Trex, from their incredible eyesight (which Jurassic Park
          certainly got wrong), that their young were likely at least partially
          feathered, and that their vocalizations probably sounded less like
          tiger roars and more like gigantic bellowing hissing crocodiles. Click
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCJ3I6QBvGw"> HERE </a> to
          listen to what Trex likely sounded like based on the structures of
          their fossilized trechea and ancestry.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/prehistoric-planet-2.jpg"
          alt="'Hank' the trex from the docuseries Prehistoric Planet with young trex"
        />
        <p class="facts-paragraphs">
          Of course, we have also learned a lot about many of other species of
          dinosaur too. Trex was one of the first theropod fossils ever
          categorically discovered and was thusly named "King of the Lizards",
          but that name is incorrect for several reasons. For example, we now
          know that dinosaurs were not exactly reptiles nor lizards (though they
          share a common ancestor), but an entirely different type of animal.
          And second, we now know of many other theropods that are much bigger
          and stronger than Trex. For example, the afforementioned Spinosaurus
          is actually bigger than Trex in both height and length. As for
          stronger, Allosaurus, while not bigger than Trex, reportedly was much
          stronger and was able to take down pray twice the size of Trex. As a
          <a id="paleonerd">Paleonerd</a>, it's important to know this as
          claiming Trex to be the "strongest" or "biggest" carnivore will likely
          set of a chorus of other nerds echoing "Actually! &#129299;". All that
          said, while Trex may not be the biggest, one thing most of us
          <a id="paleonerd">Paleonerds</a> agree on is Trex is still the
          **BEST**. With a stronger bite force than any animal that has ever
          lived and a legend and icon of dinosauria ever since it's discovery in
          1905, for many people around the world, Trex holds a special place in
          their hearts, and that is why Trex is the best dinosaur to ever walk
          the earth.

        <h3>Chickens and Dinosaurs</h3>
        <p class="facts-paragraphs">
          You may have snidely heard from somewhere that chickens are the
          ancestors of the mighty trex. To be clear, this just isn't true.
          Chickens did not evolve from Trex. And birds did not evolve from
          dinosaurs... birds ARE dinosaurs.
        </p>
        <p class="facts-paragraphs">
          Similar in the way that cats did not evolve from tigers but instead
          evolved from some common feline ancestor over 6 million years ago,
          birds and dinosaurs like Trex and Tricerotops, all evolved from the
          same dinosaur common ancestor. In other words, birds didn't evolve
          from some trex, but rather, bird ancestors lived alongside other
          theropods during the Triassic period. This graph below is a great
          summary of all we have learned so far, including how crocodilian and
          pterosaurs were not dinosaurs.

          alt="Evolutionary tree showing dinosaurs and other closely related animals"
        />
        <p class="facts-paragraphs">
          This is actually one of my favorite facts about dinosaurs because it
          really drives home the point that dinosaurs ARE animals! In fact,
          paleotologists call birds "Avian Dinosaurs". It's sad sometimes to
          think about the fact we will never get to see those amazing animals in
          person- you will never meet a tricerotops, a stegosaurus, or a trex
          (though, maybe that last one is for the best...). But when you truly
          observe birds, you can see it in the way that they walk and the shape
          of their feet, that they clearly are dinosaurs walking among us.
